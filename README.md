1. About Stakeholder
Sports Tech Institute Australia Pty Ltd (SportsTeck) is an institution focused on
advancing knowledge and expertise in sports technology, sports data, and
innovation. They offer a range of accredited programs and courses designed to
prepare students for the rapidly evolving field of sports technology. These courses
cover topics such as robotics, smart-stadium technology, VR athlete training,
esports, and more. The college is future-focused, aiming to be at the forefront of
sports science and education.
In addition to education, Sports Tech College also provides consulting services to
businesses, helping them navigate and implement the latest sports technology
innovations. They offer tailored advice, short-term engagements, and managed

2. About this project
The project aims to create a centralized online platform, "sportstechshop.com,"
where global buyers can easily find and purchase sports technology products.
Currently, there's no unified marketplace, as each supplier operates their own site,
making it difficult for consumers to know where to shop. This project focuses on
enabling suppliers to easily upload their products and business information into
relevant categories, ensuring an intuitive and seamless user experience. The goal is
to attract over 2,000 vendors and showcase more than 800 sports products and
suppliers from around the world.

4. Step by Step design guideline(draft)
Phase 1
o User Story: Prepare user stories for the requirements above.
o Conceptual Model: With the user stories as a reference, identify
the objects, their behaviour, relationships, and multiplicity. Use a
UML class diagram to describe the final conceptual model
containing concepts, their attributes, the relationships, and the
responsibilities.
o Data Model: Design the data model using UML, identifying primary
and foreign keys, entities, associations, and multiplicities.
o Wireframes: Design prototypes for the main web pages, for
instance, home page, user sign-in/sign-up/login, payment, shopping
cart, shopping list, item detail, about, T&C.
o Front-end programming: Using HTML, Bootstrap, CSS to develop
UI/UX according to wireframes.
o Back-end development(prototype): Using Python and its
framework(Flask, Blueprint) to set up web server. Set up database
using MySQL or MangoDB. Set up web app logic using Python
Object-oriented design.
Phase 2
o Product Management: Product Listings: Create detailed product
pages with high-quality images, descriptions, prices, and
categories.
o Compliance: Ensure compliance with legal requirements for data
protection (exploratory in nature)
o Functionality Testing: Ensure all features work correctly, including
forms, links, and shopping cart.
o Performance Testing: Test the site’s load time and responsiveness
